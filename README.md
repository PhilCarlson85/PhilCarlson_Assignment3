Create a Node.js RESTful application that connects to MongoDb. The data can be imported directly from the Mongo DB sample data.

Import the MongoDB sample data
The sample data can be imported using the mongoimport command. The restaurant data can be found here: https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/import-data/

Create a REST API for the Restaurants

Deploy the REST server to AWS. You will need to re-import the data to the mongoDB instance on AWS to test.

Test each API call and take a screenshot. These screenshots, along with the github repository is the deliverable for this assignment.
